# SnakeAI
A Neural Network controlled Evolution-produced Snake AI, that plays snake to the best of it's ability.

This was a project I developed in 2019 after my A-Level exams. Entirely made just for fun, through a developing interest in AI, machine learning and evolution. The code itself is somewhat messy, admittedly it was mostly scrambled together whilst learning how it works, but the end result is a game that *can* actually learn and has even gotten high scores of around 60-70 apples which for a first attempt I'm very pleased with!
